This is my attempt of solving the windy-grid-world environment created by [dennybritz](https://github.com/dennybritz). I have been going through his previous exercises; therefore, the coding style is very similar. I solved it using Q-learning and Q(Î») in order to compare results.

- Check out my solution [here](Q-Learning.ipynb)
- The environment can be found [here](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning)
